# XMLCreator
A python program that builds a SMG2 or SMG1 XML file for you

## Notes
XMLCreator will make the XMLs in the same folder as the .py file

Please open an issue if you find any problem

Feel free to fork the github repo and make XMLCreator compatible with other games

There is a limit of memory patches but I doubt you'll reach 250 of them

Speaking of memory patches, once you enter "end", you won't be able to type in the entry box due to their complexity (was a pain to code lmfao I had to rewrite it all)

I'm looking to optimize my code so I'd be glad to read some pull requests

The "Project Template" option takes priority over the "Crash Debugger" option

Added a "Crash debugger" option

Fixed the EuEnglish line being completely absent because i'm so dumb
